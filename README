This script let you can use CTRL-P/N to complete word in cmdline mode just like in insert mode.
it also works fine with large file.

you can map other keys instead of <C-P/N> like this in your vimrc: 
               cmap <C-J> <Plug>CmdlineCompletionBackward
               cmap <C-K> <Plug>CmdlineCompletionForward

TODO:  support completion search in alternate buffers .
